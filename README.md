# ICARUS - Efficient CPU-Based 2D Render Engine

ICARUS is a lightweight and efficient CPU-based 2D render engine designed for simplicity and performance. It is built using Vite, providing a fast development environment with hot module replacement (HMR) for real-time updates.

## Features

- Efficient CPU-based rendering
- Support for 2D shapes and rendering
- Physics module for handling collisions, momentum, gravity, and elasticity
- Easy integration with Vite for development and hot reloads

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raviadi12/js-icarus-2d-gameengine.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd js-icarus-2d-gameengine
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
